# CAR-LINK

Overview:

The Traffic Insights project is a system that uses computer vision and machine learning to identify cars in images and give traffic insights. The system can be used to improve traffic flow, reduce congestion, and improve safety.

Dependencies:

Python 3.9
Flask
OpenCV
SQLite3
Installation:

To install the project, run the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt


**Usage:**

To run the project, run the following command:

python server.py

This will start the server on port 5000. You can then access the APIs at the following URLs:

http://localhost:5000/identify-car: This API identifies cars in an image and returns a JSON object containing the bounding boxes around the cars.
http://localhost:5000/give-traffic-insights: This API gives traffic insights based on a list of car bounding boxes and returns a JSON object containing the traffic insights.
Examples:

Here is an example of how to use the /identify-car API to identify cars in an image:

python
import requests

Upload the image to the server.
url = "http://localhost:5000/identify-car"
files = {"image": open("image.jpg", "rb")}
response = requests.post(url, files=files)

Get the car bounding boxes from the response.
json_boxes = response.json()

Print the car bounding boxes.
print(json_boxes)

Here is an example of how to use the /give-traffic-insights API to get traffic insights based on a list of car bounding boxes:

python
import requests

Create a list of car bounding boxes.
json_boxes = [
{
"x": 100,
"y": 100,
"width": 100,
"height": 100
},
{
"x": 200,
"y": 200,
"width": 200,
"height": 200
}
]

Send the car bounding boxes to the server.
url = "http://localhost:5000/give-traffic-insights"
data = {"cars": json_boxes}
response = requests.post(url, json=data)

Get the traffic insights from the response.
traffic_insights = response.json()

Print the traffic insights.
print(traffic_insights)

Deployment:

To deploy the project to production, you can use a variety of cloud platforms, such as AWS Elastic Beanstalk or Google Cloud App Engine.
